This repository contains all iterations in order to the final project. The release version is the <b><u>Iteration 6</b></u> folder. 

## About the Project

### Overview

The goal of the project was to create an implementation of the Brick Breaker game with all functionalities. The application must support an Admin EX flow as well as a Player EX flow. The admin creates the games, assigns blocks (position, color, etc) and assigns other various game settings (speed increase factor, paddle size...) The player can then join in these games, with lives, competing on a level from 1-99 at a time and try to have the best score in the Hall of Fame. All functionalities from a classic brick breaker game must be present, i.e. the ball must be able to collide off walls, paddle, and hit the blocks. 

The application was built employing a Model-View-Controller pattern using Java and the Swing Framework for the GUI. The following technical tools were essential in our development: 
* WindowBuilder - an eclipse graphical plugin that automatically generates Swing components
* Umple - A tool/language to embed models in code, vice versa, and generate complete systems

### Additional Features Implemented
Beyond the scope of the project, we implemented the following additional features: 

* 1 vs 1 mode, so players can play other players using same keyboard
* Multiple UX improvements, for example when users would delete a block, they would have to drag it to Pacman's mouth, who would begin eating it. We also had an appealing sign-in screen with a ball bouncing within the containers of the frame.

## How To Play

* Clone the repository to your computer
* Import the "Iteration 6" project into your IDE (Eclipse is recommended)
* Simply click run within the IDE. 
* The game should open up in a JAR applet.
